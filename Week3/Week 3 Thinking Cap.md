# UX Design Thinking Cap

## Reaction Piece
I thought the introduction video gave a good overview of the UX Design process and its applications. I had no idea that there were so many specialized roles even within the divison of UX like user researcher, interaction designer, and visual designer! From the article, it's also interesting to see that UX is a people-first role, where they prioritize how to make products or features more intuitive and enjoyable for their users. I think UX is often overlooked because it exists in so many everyday tools and technologies that people take it for granted. The article and video gave me a fresh perspective on the role, and that it's a very important and intentional part of the intersection between business, people, and technology.
