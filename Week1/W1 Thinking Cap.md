## What is the site's agenda?
The website, PurpleAir, aims to inform users about air quality around the world. Using air sensors marked by colored dots on the interactive map, this website can provide live updates pn air quality based on various industry standards, temperature, and humidity.

## Why does this website “speak” to you?
This website "speaks" to me because as a native Californian, we are prone to intense wildfire seasons, where the air quality can reach very unhealthy levels. Last summer, I often checked this site to look at how air quality changed on an hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and week-to-week level in my area (NorCal), in contrast to other parts of California.

## How does the mapping work, and does it “work?” i.e., in your opinion, does it do what it’s supposed to do?
This map works because it is relatively straightforward to understand as a visualization on its own. Intuitively, we can see that green means good air quality, yellow means okay, and red/burgunday means unhealthy, potentially hazardous.

Although this map is functional, it could be improved if the data were portrayed with a heat map, indicating the air quality levels in areas where the air sensors are close together or overlapping. This could help make visualize the information in a more gradual manner as opposed to isolated places using dots.


## What technologies does the map use? I.e. Google maps, leaflet, mapbox, etc?
On the screenshot, PurpleAir credits MapTiler and OpenStreetMap in contributing to the creation of the map. On their website, PurpleAir also indicates usage of Google Maps to register their air quality sensors and Mapbox for the map interface.


## If you could change something, what would it be?
I would change this website so that there would be two options for viewing: one for the general public, and one for evironmental researchers. I think the current screenshot is more suited for environmental researchers. For researchers, we could add a few more advanced options to filter by, like other industry standard metrics. 

But as a general citizen and a non-expert of air quality, I feel that the numbers within each circle don't mean much to me. I think it would be more clear if we were able to describe the color legend with words/phrases understood by the general public like "Good", "Unhealthy", "Unhealthy for Sensitive Individuals", etc.
